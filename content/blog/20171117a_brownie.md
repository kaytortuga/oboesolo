I don't consider myself an avid baker. I enjoy making cookies of various shapes, sizes, and flavors from scratch, but I have traditionally made brownies from a box. Why? Well, when you find something that works, you stick with it. Or, if you are me, you try to improve it or create variations with minimal effort. That, dear reader, is the subject of this post.

Disclaimer(s): not for those with gluten or egg allergy, probably not for those sensitive to dairy, and some variations not suitable for those with nut allergies.

If you're fine with all those or are just looking for ideas that you can tweak, read on!

# The Base

Foundations are important. I have tried many boxed brownies over the years, but my current preference is the lovely Triple Chocolate mix by Ghiradelli. Whatever your base, make it something you enjoy on its own.

For a single bag of this stuff, it's as simple as mixing 1 egg, 1/3 cup veggie oil, and 1/3 cup water in a 2qt+ bowl then adding in the dry brownie mix. Grease your 8 square inch pan, pour in the deliciousness, toss it in the 325 degree preheated oven, and bake for 35min (I like them just barely done).

Fun story, I just wrote that down from memory. Let's check the back of the box to see how well I remembered it.

Pretty darn close. I probably check them at 35min and add more time as needed. On its own, it's a nice rich chewy brownie. Great topped with ice cream or whipped cream or served with a glass of milk. Yes, chocolate and dairy are the best of friends in my book.

But what if there were more to the story?

# Variations on a Theme

## Substitutions

If you enjoy a good mocha and have the know-how and materials on hand to make a good cup of coffee, swap out the 1/3 cup water with 1/3 cup of black coffee. Let the beverage cool before adding it in so it doesn't affect the bake and mix everything else as normal. The more potent the coffee, the stronger the flavor effect. Yum.

If coconut in desserts is your jam, consider leaving the water as is and replacing the 1/3 cup veggie oil with 1/3 cup coconut oil. The result is a deliciously moist brownie with that essence of coconut complementing the chocolate.

## Additions

This brownie mix comes with chocolate chips in it already, but in theory you could add always add more. But if I'm going to add morsels, I try to make it a different flavor and color. For a one-bag recipe, once you've mixed the standard ingredients, toss in 1-2 cups of the following. (Don't add <i>all</i> of them at once per se, unless you are feeling especially courageous. Go for one type of addition per batch.)

* Reeses Pieces
* Butterscotch chips
* White chocolate morsels
* Pecan pieces

I'm sure there are others you could add. These are just some that I have tried and loved.

Now, suppose you leave the base unaltered. If mint and chocolate floats your boat, the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance comes in the form of one or two drops of peppermint extract, added to the mix after the base has been combined. Two drops sounds small, but the effect is mighty. Great for a winter holiday party or just for a change of pace.

# Wrap-up

I hope this post gave you some fun ideas for sprucing up your standard brownie mix. Happy experimenting!

Thanks for reading. Cheers!
